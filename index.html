								<p>Greetings, I am Tinodaishe Ronald Simbanegavi an aspiring software developer. To give you a bit of a background about myself: I was born in Zimbabwe and moved to South Africa when I was 8 years old. I had my whole schooling career here in South Africa and it was an exciting experience and I had dreamt of becoming a mechatronic engineer for the longest time until July 2021(Grade 12) when everything changed.</p>
								<p>My coding journey started in January 2022, It would be an understatement to say  that it started terribly. In high school I learnt HTML and CSS so I had a coding background and learning a new language was not arduous task, thus I decided to learn python seeing as it is allegedly the easiest language to start with. I did a couple of python courses and dropped them halfway through, watched some python tutorial youtube videos but i still felt like I was going in circles so I decided to read a book called: "Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition" where I learned python and the django framework.</p>
								<ul> My skills are:
									<li>Python</li>
									<li>Django</li>
									<li>MySQL</li>
									<li>HTML</li>
									<li>CSS</li>
									<li>HTML</li>
									<li>HTML</li>
									<li>Excellent problem solving skills</li>
									<li>Excellent communication skills</li>
									
								</ul>
